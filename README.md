# do-over-directory-tree.jl

`do-over-directory-tree.jl` is a [rep](http://librep.sourceforge.net/)
function for working over a directory tree and doing things to each file it
finds. It could possibly do with some added error checking and the like but
it was a quick 'n' dirty attempt to demonstrate to someone how it could be
done with rep.
